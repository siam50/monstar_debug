    <h2 class="text-warning text-center mt-5">What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
    <p class="fw-bold">Local Storage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Local storage is the most recent mechanism.</li>
        <li>It allows for larger amounts of data to be stored</li>
        <li>Data is not deleted when the browser is closed.</li>
        <li>Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="fw-bold">Session Storage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Session storage is similar to cookies.</li>
        <li>Data is only stored for the current session.</li>
        <li>Data will be deleted when the user closes the browser</li>
        <li> Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text-warning text-center mt-5">What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">Global Scope:</span> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are
        known as global variables and have global
        scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or
        conditional state can access that variable.</p>
    <p><span class="fw-bold">Block Scope:</span> Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be
        defined as the scope of the variables
        inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something
        else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>
    <h2 class="text-warning text-center mt-5">How does work event loop in Javascript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript language is single-threaded and the asynchronous behaviour is not part of the JavaScript language
        itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language in the browser (or the programming
        environment) and accessed through the browser APIs. The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call
        Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the
        queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the
        Event Loop.</p>
